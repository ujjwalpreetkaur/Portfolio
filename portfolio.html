        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Ujjwalpreet kaur, a web developer with a knack for crafting clean and functional designs. Currently pursuing a BTech in CSE, I’m working on my first project—a Campus Navigation System website—because getting lost on campus should be a thing of the past! Beyond web development, I have a growing fascination with networks and how they keep our digital world connected. I also dabble in C and Python , constantly looking for ways to make my code both efficient and mildly entertaining. When I’m not debugging, you’ll find me diving into news blogs, decoding market trends, or getting lost in a good book</p>
